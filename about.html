                                My team and I created a fully functional prototype website and app for our client The Wild Vet, as a part of our major industry project at University that has a span of a year during semester 1 and semester 2 of my last year at University, and I made the Website myself. Throughout the course of the project I learned so much about project management, project planning, coding, functionality, design, and as well as coherently coordinating with other group members. We also used industry-grade applications, tools and languages such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code, GitHub, Atlassian Jira, Microsoft Teams, Bootstrap, Google Firebase, Javascript, C#, HTML and CSS.

                             I am currently working as Service Desk Analyst at Harvey Norman Information Technology, in this role I have learnt a lot about communicating, identifying, analysing, logging and/or even resolving major and minor IT related issues. This role gave me an opportunity to really enhance my overall communication skills and problem solving skills delivered through taking phone calls in a fast-paced environment. Later in the role, I was introduced to Level 2 tasks such as User Provisioning Active Directory (AD) in which I was able to perform Creating, Amending (SAP/Gift Card/NCF) and Deleting AD Accounts, Email processing which significantly improved my reading and responding skills, and Duty Coordinator (DC) task that allowed me to take on IT related issues at my own pace. On weekend shifts is where I got more exposure on major types of incidents, I experienced identifying / managing major incidents, working and communicating with other IT teams in the company to be able to resolve major incidents, and sending out comms.
